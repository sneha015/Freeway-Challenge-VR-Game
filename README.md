# Freeway Challenge VR Game

Freeway challenge is a fun Virtual Reality Game, you will need Cardboard/VR headset to mount your phone and play.

The game is all about crossing number of freeways, for the beginner level, the traffic is only coming from the left side, 
so when ever you cross the freeway, u have to look for the vehicles on the left and carefully cross the road. 
As you go further in to challenging levels, the speed of the traffic increases and number of vehicles on the road increases 
making the game more challenging.

Apart from this, there is also wild fire chasing you from behind, u have to keep going further crossing freeways, if u stop in the middle, the wild fire will kill you.

The final score appears in terms of number of meters you travelled without being killed by wild fire or road accident.
